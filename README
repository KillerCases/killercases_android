KILLERCASES ANDROID

--------------------------------------
#### INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BUILD APP ###

Build and sign your app using the CLI
To use the Titanium CLI to package your Android application, after you have created your keystore, run the following command
ti build -p android -T dist-playstore -K /Users/jwightman/Dropbox/KillerCasesKeystore -P Management2011 -L killercases -O /Users/jwightman/Dropbox/killercases_android

Verify your app is signed correctly and ready to be uploaded
Before uploading, you should verify that the APK file was created and signed correctly. You'll do so with another Android SDK command-line tool. At the command prompt, enter:
jarsigner -verify -verbose /Users/jwightman/Dropbox/killercases_android/killercases.apk
